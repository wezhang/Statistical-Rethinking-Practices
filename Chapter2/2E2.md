The expression Pr(Monday|rain) is supposed to be _the probability of a rainng day being Monday_. I think the answer `(3)` is more close.

> (3) The probability that it is Monday, given that it is raining.

I changed my mind from `(2)` to `(3)`. The clause after _given_ would be the priority condition.
