Refer to the assumption,

For Earth, globe is 70% covered in water, then

    Pr(water|Earth) = 70%

For Mars, globe is 100% land, then

    Pr(water|Mars) = 0

    Pr(Earth|land) = 23%, to get Pr(Earth) = ?

We can convert the water probablility to land:

    Pr(land|Earth) = 30%, Pr(land|Mars) = 100%

The equirment formular is:

    Pr(Earth|land) * Pr(land) = Pr(land|Earth) * Pr(Earth)

Since that each globe was equally likely to be toosed, so all land (Earth + Mars) probablility is :

    Pr(land) = (23% + 100%) / 2 = 61.5%

Then:

    Pr(Earth) = Pr(Earth|land) * Pr(land) / Pr(land|Earth)
              = 23% * 61.5% / 30%
              = 47.15%
