## Condition

Panda A:

- Twins: 10%
- Single infant: 90%

Panda B:

- Twins: 20%
- Single infant: 90%

## Questions

A Female panda has just given birth to twins. What's the probability that her next birth will also be twins?

## Answer

    Pr(T|A) = 10%
    Pr(T|B) = 20%
    Pr = Pr(T|A) * Pr(A) + Pr(T|B) * Pr(B)

Suppose 10% means 1 way of 10.

| Speci | p of twins | ways to get 1st twins | Plausibility |
|-------|------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| A | 10% | 1 | 1/3 |
| B | 20% | 2 | 2/3 |

    Pr(2nd twins) = 10% * 1/3 + 20% * 2/3 = 1/6
