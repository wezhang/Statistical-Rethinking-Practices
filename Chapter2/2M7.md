# 2M5

## Conditions

We get:

- Card 1: B B
- Card 2: B W
- Card 3: W W

## All conjecture

| Card No. | 1st Pull | 2nd Pull
|----------|----------|----------
| 1 | B/B | B/W
| 1 | B/B | W/B
| 1 | B/B | W/W
| 1 | B/B | W/W
| 1 | B/B | B/W
| 1 | B/B | W/B
| 1 | B/B | W/W
| 1 | B/B | W/W
| 2 | B/W | B/B
| 2 | B/W | B/B
| 2 | B/W | W/W
| 2 | B/W | W/W
| 2 | W/B | ...
| 3 | W/W | ...
| 3 | W/W | ...

1st Black is up and 2nd White is up count is 8, in those conjecture, then the 1st pull Black in downside count is 6, so the probability is `6/8 = 0.75`.
